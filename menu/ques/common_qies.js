                                  Our 6-meal plan is perfect for a person looking for 6 dinners (or lunches!) a week. On
                                  average, our meals weigh in at
                                  about 13 ounces and range from 300 to 650 calories. If you have a larger household, we
                                  do offer a 12 meal per week
                                  subscription (it’s perfect for couples or a family of 4 looking for 3 meals per week).
                                  Plus, you can always order
                                  multiple subscriptions.

                              <p>Our meals are chef prepared and delivered fresh, so typically they have a refrigerated
                                  shelf life of about 3-5 days.
                                  Select items (such as seafood) are best eaten first, so we’ll add a badge on the package
                                  to let you know. We usually
                                  suggest enjoying these meals within the first few days of receiving your order, but you
                                  can always check their exact
                                  use-by date on the back-of-pack nutrition label. If you’re ever unable to finish your
                                  meals within their shelf life, you
                                  can always pop them into the freezer for extended storage. Just be sure to microwave
                                  your meal straight from the freezer
                                  and add a few extra minutes to reach the 165° F internal temperature we recommend.

                                  you’ll find our easy steps for heating, but generally, the meals heat up in about 3
                                  minutes (depending on your
                                  microwave). If you’re unsure, start at 2 minutes and heat in 30–second increments until
                                  the meal reaches an inner
                                  temperature of 165° F. Our meals are packaged to be heated in the microwave (for the
                                  ultimate convenience), but you can
                                  heat them in the oven if you’d like. Just so you know, our current meal containers
                                  aren’t safe for the oven or stovetop,
                                  so you’ll have to transfer your food to heat it up. You can check out the full oven
